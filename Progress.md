# MR4 Companion: progress

## State
- 2026-11-08: v1 scaffold (encyclopedia first, user's choice; repo name mr4-companion). Tabs Monsters / Techniques /
  Items / Tournaments; detail overlays cross-link monster, breed, technique, item, tournament. 335 monster renders
  (3/4 view); the 5 special monsters (King Shiden, Don Mudleone, Garp, Zevion x2) have no model set and show
  "no render". Live 2026-11-08: https://misterwtheface-oss.github.io/mr4-companion/ (Pages from main, auto-deploys on
  push; Cloudflare beacon not added until public release).

## Open
- [ ] Item pictures: MR4 items are 3D models (MO4_ITEM = model textures, not icons); render them like the monsters.
- [ ] Technique icons: 408 pictograms in MON_WZP (64x32); the technique -> icon lookup is not decoded (no guessing).
- [ ] Technique element / category names (MF4_MSG) not decoded; shown fields are guts, hit, damage, withering,
      sharpness, heal, follow-up.
- [ ] Stat grade scale and growth type meaning: shown as raw numbers.
- [ ] Book routes: real album titles for discs; "From Book" stat generation (extract REQUESTS / 05_summon Q5).
- [ ] Planner features (raising, combining) after the encyclopedia.
- [ ] Data status in the extract is "raw extract, not yet verified in game".

## Session log
- 2026-11-08 [mr4.app] What changed and why: v1 encyclopedia built and published (user: encyclopedia first, repo
